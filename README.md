# ChildTimetable

Hosted at <https://childtimetable.co.uk> this child-entertainment idea generator helps parents (like me) set out a schedule to entertain their children on the weekend.

*I'm not kidding, I got the idea from a very old, but very useful episode of super-nanny when my children finally "got to me" as we'd just not had time to plan anything to entertain them with one weekend.*

Hosted 100% for free it uses:

* Domain name from [lcn.com](https://www.lcn.com) (free for a year thanks to an offer they had at time of writing)
* The truly amazing an free-in-preview [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/static/) which host a...
* [Blazor Web Assembly App](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/azure-static-web-apps-with-blazor/)
* [CosmosDB (Free Tier)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cosmos-db/)

Made with nothing but a few hours across a few evenings *(hey, did I mention I have children - therefore no time?)*.

Finally, there's just something truly magical about adding new CosmosDB entries in VS Code, simply because the Azure CosmosDB extension does such a great job. It's truly an incredible time to be a developer working with Microsoft solutions.
